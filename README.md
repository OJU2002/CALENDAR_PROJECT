Project of Object Oriented Programming on Calendar.
INTRODUCTION
    The project of Object Oriented Programming is calendar. We have to prepare a software in which we have to print themonth calendar and day of the specific date. 
This software is programmed in Dev C++. The software is basically designed to print calendar and find the day of a given date from 1990.
This software is very useful for all the sectors.More over this type of software is very much used today in cell phones and computers etc. 

CALENDAR
This is a simple catalogue of a calendar. In the program, the user has two choices to view the date. 
The first option requires the user to enter a valid day, month and year. 
After processing the output will be shown of the respective day the entered date had been or will be. 
The second option requires the user to enter a desired month and year. 
Then the calendar layout of the entered month of that year will be given as output. 
This current build of the project supports from the year 1900 to 2400. There is also a third option which exits the current running program.
